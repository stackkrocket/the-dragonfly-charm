# The Dragonfly Charm

## Can You Catch The Magic?

> *"One day the dragonflies appear sudden as the sun. Speed and softness, they lash sky to air in silent seams"*<br/>
> Ken Craft

> *"There are so many reasons to fall in love withdragonflies. They have intriguing stories to tell us. They make our world a beautiful place. And they are scrappy survivors"*<br/>
> Cindy Crosby, Chasing Dragonflies

A dargonfly depicts many traits. Traits, we humans can immitate. It is energetic, fast, beautiful and a survivor. I remember, as a kid, my friends and I would chase drgaonflies
across open field for long periods of time, teased by its speed, agility and its ability to effortlessly glide in flight. We always marvelled by its ability to lash and dash past us
effortlessly. 

Till I grew up, I never had any success catching any. That was soon to change or so it seems several years later.

## A Moment of Magic, Truth and Stillness

> *"Magic is seeing wonder in nature's every little thing, seeing how wonderful fireflies are and how magical are the dragonflies"*<br/>
> Ama H. Vanniarachchy

Several years later, having outgrown the habit of relentlessly chasing dragonflies, the moment of truth would be upon me on a fateful evening taking a casual stroll.

There it was, sitting still on what seemed to be the remnants of what once was a tree, in all of its magic and glory. A still dragonfly was a rare to me thinking back to my
yester years about all the chasing I had once done. I knew this was a moment of truth for me. I knew I needed to capture it, not just the dragonfly but also the moment - something
that I can keep even after many years later, I would look at it and say to myself, "I caught a dragonfly".

I got close as much as I could, as quiet as possible, took out my phone which was at the time a Tecno Camon 11 (2018) and ever so carefully, captured the beautiful, magical and still
moment. 

## Aftermath

> *"The dragonfly brings dreams to reality and is the messenger of wisdom and enlightenment from other realms"*<br/>
> Uknown

It's been four (4) years now since that fateful, magical day. I never dwelled much on it. I took it as my moment of truth and carried on quietly. I would habitually bring up the image
on my phone, stare at it briefly, adore the photo of the dragonfly - this was mine!

The advent and rise of NFTs has provided the space for rare moments like this to be procured as collectibles and to a high degree maintain ownership of your work. I am eploring
murky waters and hope I find what I seek. I am by no means a photographer. This was a rare moment which I happened to capture. This was my moment of truth.

> *"May you touch dragonflies and stars, dance with fairies and talk to the moon"*
